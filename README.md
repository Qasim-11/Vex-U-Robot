# VEX U Competition - Robot Tasks

This document outlines the main tasks and considerations for our VEX U competition robot.

## The Robot's Tasks:

### 1. "Get it to Work" Part:

1. **Initialize all motors and sensors properly**  
   - Ensure all motors are correctly configured and mapped to the correct ports.
   - Calibrate sensors such as gyroscope, ultrasonic sensors, and encoders.
   - Test each motor and sensor to ensure functionality before programming complex behaviors.

2. **Basic driving functions**  
   - Write code to move forward, backward, turn left, and right using driver input.
   - Test responsiveness and fine-tune motor control to ensure smooth movement.

3. **Basic object manipulation functions**  
   - Code the arms, claws, or manipulators to pick up and release objects.
   - Test object manipulation under driver control to ensure seamless operation.

4. **Safety and error handling**  
   - Implement safety checks, such as stopping motors if they encounter too much resistance.
   - Set up error handling for unexpected sensor or motor failures (e.g., reset motors).

### 2. Autonomous Part:

1. **Path Planning**  
   - Plan a precise route to key game elements (scoring objects, zones) using the A* Algorithm.
   - Avoid obstacles and other robots.
   - Use sensors like ultrasonic or vision to adjust for real-time conditions and positioning.

2. **Object Interaction (scoring)**  
   - Identify objects (robots, rings, scoring bars).
   - Pick up and move objects.
   - Score objects in the correct zones.

---

### 3. Human-Controlled Part:

1. **Control**  
   - Connect the robot to a controller.
   - Respond to driver inputs swiftly for quick navigation.
   - Accurately grab, lift, and move objects with driver control.

---

### 4. Endgame Tasks:

1. **Positioning**  
   - Align the robot in designated scoring zones before time runs out.

2. **Special Endgame Tasks**  
   - Perform tasks like climbing or lifting (depending on the game) to maximize points.
   - Coordinate with alliance partners for endgame strategy.

### 5. Sensor Integration:

1. Use vision sensors to identify and track game elements during both autonomous and driver control phases.
2. Use ultrasonic or LIDAR sensors to measure distance and avoid obstacles.
3. Use gyroscopes and encoders for accurate path corrections and positioning.

---

### 6. System Health:

1. Monitor battery voltage and current during the match to ensure optimal performance.
2. Detect motor overheating or strain and adjust power output to prevent damage.

---

### 7. Strategic Considerations:

1. Balance offensive and defensive play during the match.
2. Adjust strategies based on opponent behavior and real-time conditions.
3. Optimize scoring during both autonomous and human-controlled phases.
